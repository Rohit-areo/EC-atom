    <h1>NetWorking</h1>

    <p>
        The computer Networking is the act of connecting computers and devices for sharing resources & information. It is an indispensable part of modern technology, allowing people to
        interact and transmit information among different systems.
        About LANs, WANS and the internet There are various forms of networking-- local area networks (LANs), wide area networks (WANs) and Internet connections being examples.

            Key Concepts in Networking:
        </h1>
        <ol>
            <li><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-lan/" target="">LAN (Local Area Network):</a> A LAN is a computer network that is limited to some specified geographic area, say one building or even one campus. It allows connected devices to share resources-files, printers and internet access.</li>
            <li><a href="" target="">WAN (Wide Area Network):</a> WANs differ from LAN's in that they cover a larger geographic area; and it is common to see WAN s link up several LAN-based networks. The internet is regarded as a worldwide WAN in itself. To make sure that data is transmitted smoothly between otherwise-remote locations, WANs rely on products such as routers and switches.</li>
            <li><a href="" target="">Internet:</a> The internet is the world's greatest communications network, connecting millions of private, public and academic networks as well as most businesses and government offices. It is based on the TCP/IP protocol suite which enables standardized communications among disparate devices and networks.</li>
            <li><a href="" target="">Protocols:</a> Networking protocols are rules and conventions governing the communication of devices on a network. (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is the fundamental protocol suite for the internet.</li>
            <li><a href="" target="">IP Addressing: </a> Each device on a network is assigned an IP (Internet Protocol) address, which serves as its identifier. Therefore, IP addresses play a very important role in the routing of data across networks. Among other things, there are IPv4 addresses (e.g., 192.168.1.l) and the newer introduced addressing system of tungyenIPwhich were brought into widespread use in response to the shortage of available IPv4 address space significance).</li>
            <li><a href="" target="">Routers and Switches:</a> Playing prominent roles in sending and turning back the flood of data traffic are routers and switches, networking devices that route (or direct) information. Routers link different networks, while switches bind devices together within a single network.</li>
            <li><a href="" target="">Wireless Networking:</a> Devices are wirelessly connected based on Wi-Fi technology, so there is no need for the physical cables of old days. Homes, offices, and public spaces are generally equipped with Wi-Fi.</li>
            <li><a href="" target="">Firewalls and Security: </a> Safety is an important part of networking. Firewalls are used to monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on previously set security rules. Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) provide secure communication across the internet.</li>
            <li><a href="" target="">Cloud Networking: </a> Cloud computing means providing services and resources over the internet, relying on network infrastructure. Internetworking lets users call up applications and information from afar.</li>
            <li><a href="" target="">Network Topologies: </a>The topology of a network is its physical or logical structure. The various topologies can be divided into four major types: bus, star, ring and mesh. Each has its advantages and disadvantages.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Networking forms the backbone of communication and data exchange in today's digital age. Therefore, graduates need to be thoroughly versed in this area if they are IT professionals. It includes a large area of technologies and concepts. And as the range is expanding, it continues to reshape the world's networks.</p>
